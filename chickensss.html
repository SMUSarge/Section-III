<h1>Chicken</h1>
 <i>(Gallus domesticus)</i> is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets[1] or for cockfighting.

<b>Chickens</b> are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chickens are usually relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[19] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[20] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[19] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[21]

    Chickens are omnivores.[22] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[23] and young mice.[24] A chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[25] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[26]
    
    Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".[27][28] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.[29] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young fox.[30]

    Crowing (with audio)
    A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other males,[31] and in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to call their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or on the ground.[32]</p>
